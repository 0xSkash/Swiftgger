# Swiftgger

Swiftgger is simple library which generates for you objects which are compatible with OpenAPI version 3.0. Generated objects can be serialized and returned by your API endpoint. URL to that endpoint can be used in Swagger. Thanks to this you have GUI which shows you exactly how your API looks like and you can use that GUI to execute endpoints.
